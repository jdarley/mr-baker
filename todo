Nokia namespace renmae
entertainment namespace rename
nokia namespace will need to be overwritable or just use config?
image bakes will need to be overwritable - some kind of dynamic config thing? would be cool to have them autoregister routes for building and maybe even schedules
scheduler currently works on nokia public image time - doesn't really make sense
